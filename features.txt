Tracer:
    Data recorded: 
    - Foreground window using Applescript
    - Commands run on terminal applications using a hook into bash-pre-exec
    - Screencast and Audio using Quicktime
    - Audio and video segmented by foreground window and commands run using ffmpeg
    - File changes:
        - Continuously monitor processes (and their children) started after the tracer starts
        - dtrace records all "open", "write", "close", "unlink", "rename" syscalls
        - Filter out syscalls not made by processes (and children) started after the tracer starts
        - Copies of files are made (with a random key appended to the filename)
        - record syscall metadata onto a log with data including
            - syscall
            - timestamp
            - original path
            - new file name
    - Keystrokes by tapping into Apple's CGEventCallback

    Postprocessing:
    - Associate file changes with command/window

Editor:
    - Remove/Collapse windows [Merge 2 nodes of same window (if middle window is removed)]
    - Remove/Collapse commands
    - Remove/Collapse file changes
    - Change screencast playback speed default
    - Show diffs of file changes
    - Add captions for command or window
    - Add file validations (Validate or Validate Exact)
    - Add bash script for validation
    - Intelligent defaults:
        - Collapse windows by default if:
            - Less than 5 seconds and
            - Less than 10 keystrokes and
            - No file changes under $HOME
        - Collapse commands if no fs changes made

Viewer:
    - List all Windows
    - List all commands in windows if present
    - Show file changes, screencasts, summaries made in windows and commands
    - Control playback speed of screencast
    - Collapse/Expand windows, commands, files changes
    - Validate command:
        - Checks if all files that have been marked for validation
        - Force clobber files marked for validation after prompting user
        - runs the validation script if present
    - Validate window:
        - validate each command in the window (as mentioned above)
        - Force clobber files marked for validation listed under the window (and not the child commands) after prompting user
        - run the validation script if present

    - Player: (work still ongoing)
        - Play command:
            - run command
            - validate command
            - force clobber files marked for validation criteria after prompting user
        - Play window:
            - run each command in the window (as mentioned above)
            - Validate window
            - Force clobber files marked for validation listed under the window (and not the child commands) after prompting user
